# timeseriesforecsating
This project is about time series forecasting using Depp RNN , LSTM in general using sequence to sequence forecasting. 
The dataset used in this forecsating is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data/data, which contains data from 2013 to 2017 on weather data for Delhi.
Techniques used in this forecasting
    1. EDA : removing null values, viz data, fromatting data and checking for seasonaloty. 
    2. Time series techniques : differencing , cyclical encoding, SARIMA model. 
    3. Machine Learning Techniques : Scaling two diff ways, linear RNN, Univariate RNN forecasting, Multivariate RNN forecasting. 

Baseline for this whole project is based on initial MAE from SARIMA model, at the end with scaling and Deep RNN which was able to pass that baseline set by SARIMA.
